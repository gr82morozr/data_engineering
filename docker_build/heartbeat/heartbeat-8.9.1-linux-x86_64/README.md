# Welcome to Heartbeat 8.9.1

Ping remote services for availability and log results to Elasticsearch or send to Logstash.

## Getting Started

To get started with Heartbeat, you need to set up Elasticsearch on
your localhost first. After that, start Heartbeat with:

     ./heartbeat -c heartbeat.yml -e

This will start Heartbeat and send the data to your Elasticsearch
instance. To load the dashboards for Heartbeat into Kibana, run:

    ./heartbeat setup -e
