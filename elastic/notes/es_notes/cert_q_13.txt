# Create the index `hamlet_1` with one primary shard and no replicas
# Define a mapping for the default type "_doc" of `hamlet_1`, so 
#    that (i) the type has three fields, named `speaker`, 
#    `line_number`, and `text_entry`, (ii) `speaker` and 
#    `line_number` are unanalysed strings
# Furthermore, I want you to disable aggregations on the “line_number” field
