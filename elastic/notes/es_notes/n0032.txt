For shrink operation.


It needs to create new index as "shrinked" index.

step 1 - move all shards to SINGLE node with write block = true
  PUT source_index/_settings
  {
    "index.routing.allocation.require._name": "es-a1",
    "blocks.write": true
  }

  it doesn't move all shards, just move a set of shards (either P or R) to single node, 
  to make sure that node containscomplete set of data.


step 2 - invoke shrink API.

PUT /test-01/_shrink/test-02
{
  "settings" : {
    "index.routing.allocation.require._name": null,    // remove this, othewrise the Replica specified here cannot be allocated, UnASSIGNED error may occur
    "number_of_shards" : 1,
    "number_of_replicas" : 1,
    "blocks.write": false           // enable write.
  }
}
