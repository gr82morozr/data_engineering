when changing the replica of index, the shard relocatiing starts immediately.


PUT /sales_transaction/_settings 
{
  "number_of_replicas": 1
}
GET _cat/shards?v=true&index=sales_transaction


if number_of_replicas is too large, the same replica cannot be allocated to the same shard, then shard "UNASSIGNED" error occurs
