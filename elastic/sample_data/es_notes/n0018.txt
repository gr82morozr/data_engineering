Shrink, Force Merge

Shrinking an index is the process of reducing the number of primary shards in an index. 
It's used when you have an index that's too large and you want to decrease its footprint. Here's what you should know about shrinking:

Primary Shards Reduction: The number of primary shards is reduced, but the data itself remains intact.
Read-Only Source Index: The original index must be marked as read-only before the shrink operation.
Number of Replicas: You can specify the number of replicas for the shrunken index.

Requirements: The number of primary shards in the shrunken index must be a factor of the original index's primary shards.


Use Case: Typically used when an index becomes too large and you want to optimize storage.



Merge (Force Merge)
Merging, or force merging, is the process of reducing the number of segments within each shard. 
Segments are the underlying storage structures that hold the indexed documents. 

Here's what you should know about merging:
Segments Reduction: By merging segments, you reduce the number of segments per shard, which can make searches more efficient.
Deleting Documents: If there are deleted documents, merging can reclaim space by removing those deletions.

May Impact Performance: Running a force merge is an I/O intensive operation and can impact cluster performance if not done carefully.

Use Case: Typically used to optimize the storage and performance of an index, especially after deleting a large number of documents.

Summary

Shrink: Reduces the number of primary shards in an index, typically used for optimizing storage when an index is too large.
Merge (Force Merge): Reduces the number of segments within each shard, often used for optimizing storage and search performance, especially after deleting a significant number of documents.


Shrink: Operates at the index level, reducing the number of primary shards in the index. This can help in optimizing storage and handling large indices more effectively. particularly in scenarios where the original index was over-sharded 

Force Merge: Operates at the segment level within an index, reducing the number of segments in each shard. This can improve search performance and reclaim storage space if there are deleted documents within those segments.
