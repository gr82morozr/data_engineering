ES allocation awareness and forced awareness


1 - Step 1, need to update EACH node with node.attr to reflect the "zone", "location", "rack" ... 
    This is staic setting, can NOT be done by API
    
    For example : node.attr.rack_id: rack_one 


2 - set below to make sure ES is AWARE of this partilucar attr is used for allocation.

  PUT _cluster/settings
  {
    "persistent" : {
      "cluster.routing.allocation.exclude._name" : null,
      "cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.attributes" : "rack_id",
      "cluster.routing.allocation.awareness.force.rack_id.values": "rack_1,rack_2"
    }
  }


3 -  ES tens to assign the replica on difference "rack_id", "zone", "location" ... 
    if no node is avaliable in "reack_2", then replica is un-assigned.
