Node, Shard, Cluster, Capacity Planning


https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/master/capacity-planning.html


!! One node maps to one JVM !!

If there are two shards on a single node, by adding another node, ES automatically move one shard 
to another node with zero downtime


Fortunately, it is an easy question to answer in the specific case—​yours:

1 - Create a cluster consisting of a single server, with the hardware that you are considering using in production.
2 - Create an index with the same settings and analyzers that you plan to use in production, but with only one primary shard and no replicas.
3 - Fill it with real documents (or as close to real as you can get).
4 - Run real queries and aggregations (or as close to real as you can get).


Capacity planning should not be your first step.

First look for ways to optimize how you are using Elasticsearch. Perhaps you have inefficient queries, not enough RAM, or you have left swap enabled?

We have seen new users who, frustrated by initial performance, immediately start trying to tune the garbage collector or adjust the number of threads, instead of tackling the simple problems like removing wildcard queries
