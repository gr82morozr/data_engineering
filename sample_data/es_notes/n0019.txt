Data Stream, Index, difference

============== From ChatGPT ================


A data stream in Elasticsearch is a high-level construct that supports append-only operations. It represents a series of indices that are used to store time-series data, such as logs and metrics. Here's an overview of data streams:

Immutable: Once data is written to a data stream, it cannot be updated or deleted.
Time-Series Data: Ideal for time-based data that continuously grows, like logs or metrics.
Management: Manages a series of hidden indices behind the scenes, rolling over to new indices based on specified criteria (e.g., size, age).
Simplifies Operations: You interact with the data stream rather than individual indices, which can simplify querying and management.
Regular Index
A regular index in Elasticsearch is a basic construct where data is stored. Unlike a data stream:

Mutable: You can update and delete documents within a regular index.
General Purpose: Suitable for various types of data, not just time-series.
Manual Management: You must manage regular indices yourself, including creating new ones and handling rollovers.
Key Differences
Purpose: Data streams are specifically designed for time-series data, while regular indices are more general-purpose.
Mutability: Data streams are append-only and do not allow updates or deletes to existing data, whereas regular indices allow full CRUD operations.
Management: Data streams handle the rollover and management of underlying indices automatically, while regular indices require manual management.
