Data Model, Relationship, Nested Object


Each nested object is indexed as a separate Lucene document. 
if we indexed a single document containing 100 user objects, 
then 101 Lucene documents would be created: one for the parent document, and one for each nested object.

These extra nested documents are hidden; we can’t access them directly. 
To update, add, or remove a nested object, we have to reindex the whole document. 
It’s important to note that, the result returned by a search request is not the nested object alone; 
it is the whole document.
